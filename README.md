# Book Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering

## Overview

This project implements a book recommendation system using collaborative filtering. Collaborative filtering is a technique that makes automatic predictions about the interests of a user by collecting preferences from many users (collaborating). In this system, we leverage user-item interactions to recommend books to users based on the preferences of similar users.

## Features

- User-based Collaborative Filtering
